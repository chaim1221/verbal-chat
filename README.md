# verbal-chat

 - api: node.js | graphql; simple fast chat server. DMs, #general, users. naive implementations of everything.
 - web: react/redux ongoing 3-pane window; user select, DM, general chat. Logo. idea is to serve from a bucket if possible, although I am planning on building more containers in IAC just in case.
